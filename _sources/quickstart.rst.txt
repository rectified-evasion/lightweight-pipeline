Quickstart
----------

Rough idea:

#. Write a :file:`config.py` specifying the locations of steps, data, and other configurations.
#. Define the steps of a pipeline in separate :file:`.py` files and store them in a folder.
#. Pass the :file:`config.py` to the pipeline CLI, which will handle the execution order based on a naming convention.


Config
~~~~~~

The configuration class :class:`Config <lw_pipeline.Config>` is used to manage the configuration settings for your pipeline.
If passed a path to a file all defined variables in the file will be available as attributes of the :class:`Config <lw_pipeline.Config>` instance.

.. code-block:: python

    from lw_pipeline import Config

    config = Config("some/example/path/config.py")


.. note::

    If there is a "local" configuration file :code:`some/example/path/config_local.py` it will be loaded after the main configuration 
    file automatically.


Pipeline_Step
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:class:`Pipeline_Step <lw_pipeline.Pipeline_Step>` is an abstract base class that you can subclass to define individual steps in your pipeline. 
Each step should implement the :func:`step() <lw_pipeline.Pipeline_Step.step>` method, which contains the processing logic for that step.

.. code-block:: python

    from lw_pipeline import Config, Pipeline_Step

    class Example_Step(Pipeline_Step):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__("This is an example step.", Config())

        def step(self, data):
            return data * 2

    example_step = Example_Step()
    
    input_data = 5
    output_data = example_step.step(input_data)
    print(f"Input: {input_data}, Output: {output_data}")

In practice, it is not necessarily meant to be instantiated except for demonstration or testing.
The CLI part of the pipeline aggregates all steps and handles running them.

If you choose to run the pipeline manually, the :class:`Pipeline <lw_pipeline.Pipeline>` class can
be used to run the pipeline with a list of steps.

.. code-block:: python

    from lw_pipeline import Pipeline, Pipeline_Step, Config

    class Multiply_By(Pipeline_Step):
        def __init__(self, multiplier):
            super().__init__(f"This step multiplies by {multiplier}.", Config())
            self.multiplier = multiplier

        def step(self, data):
            return data * self.multiplier

    step1 = Multiply_By(2)
    step2 = Multiply_By(3)

    Pipeline([step1, step2]).run(1)

The :func:`run() <lw_pipeline.Pipeline.run>` method will run accepts an initial input of data and
returns the final output after running through all steps.


Pipeline_Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The abstract :class:`Pipeline_Data <lw_pipeline.Pipeline_Data>` class is used to manage the data that flows through the pipeline.
As of now, the pipeline comes with a :class:`Pipeline_MNE_BIDS_Data <lw_pipeline.Pipeline_MNE_BIDS_Data>` class that is used to handle MNE-BIDS data.


We refer to the :doc:`minimal example<minimal_example>` for a more detailed explanation.


Command line interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The package defines a :code:`lw_pipeline` CLI accepting the following arguments:

.. glossary::

    :code:`-v, --version`
        Show the version of the pipeline.

    :code:`-r, --run`
        Run the pipeline.

    :code:`steps`
        Positional argument. List of steps to run, separated by commas (only necessary to specify 00-99).

    :code:`-c, --config`
        Path to the configuration file.

    :code:`-l, --list`
        List all steps in the step directory.

    :code:`--ignore-questions`
        Ignore questions, i.e., always respond with the default answer to a question.

    :code:`--list-derivatives` (with MNE-BIDS data)
        List methods in steps that could be used to produce derivatives.

    :code:`--report` (with MNE-BIDS data)
        Generate a report of the pipeline's derivatives.

    :code:`--store-report` (with MNE-BIDS data)
        Store the report tables in `.tsv` files in the derivatives directory (e.g., `pipeline_report_bids_dir.tsv`, `pipeline_report_deriv_dir.tsv`).

    :code:`--full-report` (with MNE-BIDS data)
        Generate a full report (do not limit to subject, session, task specification in the config) of the pipeline's derivatives.
